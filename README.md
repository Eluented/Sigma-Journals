# :fire: Sigma-Media :fire:
Lap 1 Project with our amazing group: Direm, Jianli, Michael and Onur! We decided to create an anonymous social media website aimed at a specific demographic of people who are obsessed with self-improvement and helping others! :clap:

## Project Brief :thought_balloon:
* You will be working in small teams to create a community journaling website.

## Project Requirements :exclamation:

### Functionality :sun_with_face:
* Users should be able to visit the website and anonymously post journal entries.
* Users should be limited to how many characters they can put in an entry.
* Users should be able to add gifs from giphy in an entry.
* Users should be able to view other peoples' entries.
* Users should be able to react to other peoples’ entries with an emoji.
* Users should have three emojis to choose from.
* Users should be able to comment on other people’s entries.

### Technical Requirements :new_moon_with_face:
* Aim for minimum 60% test coverage (In future projects this will be enforced with an aim for 80%)
* Your repos should have excellent READMEs. See our Writing READMEs guide for details.
* Your website should be deployed (You could use eg. Netlify for client, Heroku for server)
* Your codebase should make good use of the technologies we have covered so far on the course: HTML, CSS & vanilla JS
* You may bring in some node libraries for specialised behaviour eg. dayjs but no large front end frameworks such as React.
* Your website should not have a database connected, instead any data sent and stored in your backend should be saved within .json files.

## Presentation
* Prepare a 10 minute presentation covering the following topics:
** Purpose of App
** Planning & Delivery
** Technologies and Code
** Challenges and Solutions
** Significant Code / Code you are proud of (include snippets!)
** Test Coverage
** Future Features & What We've Learned
** Live Demonstration
* There will be a 5 minute opportunity for Q&A after each presentation

## Planning :weary:
We used a Kanban Board and Adobe Illustrator to plan our our first moves and designs

## Wins :sunglasses:
* We were all enthusiastic about working on Sigma Media and had a great time!
* We learned how to work together on a project by incorporating everyone's ideas.
* On GitHub, we learned how to use the kanban board.
* We learned how to deal with merge conflicts and work on multiple projects at the same time.
* We discovered how to use socket.io to make real-time changes to our website.
* It was a lot of fun designing a female version of Chad in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom.
* It was also a lot of fun creating prototypes and our own SVG icons in Illustrator and Photoshop.
* 
## Challenges :grey_question:
* Merge conflicts :scream:
* Remembering how to use photo editing software
* Utilising socket.io for the first time
* Updating the web page in real-time
* Working with 4 people simulaltenously working on the same repository using different branches
* Getting the Users Online section working
* ### Issues with Putting Emojis in the Input
